# Before making a release, the LTVER string should be modified. The
# string is of the form c:r:a. Follow these instructions sequentially:
#   1. If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then
#      increment revision ('c:r:a' becomes 'c:r+1:a').
#   2. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
#      update, increment current, and set revision to 0 ('c:r:a' becomes 'c+1:0:a').
#   3. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
#      increment age ('c:r:a' becomes 'c:r:a+1').
#   4. If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last public
#      release, then set age to 0 ('c:r:a' becomes 'c:r:0').
